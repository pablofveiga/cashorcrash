# Cash or Crash!

This project uses  **Grunt** task manager in order to run the **SASS**, **Copy** and **Watch** tasks with **NPM**.
The SCSS files are using **BEM** methodology, for getting more efficient **CSS direct selectors**.


## Files
There is a "SRC" folder, where you can compile and compress SCSS and JS files.
The "DIST" folder contains the compiled CSS file and the rest of necessary files for the project.


## Ruby On Rails for SASS

In order to compile SCSS you will need to install the SASS gem from Ruby.
If you are using Windows, you will have to install Railsinstaller for windows.
If you are not going to modify SCSS files, ignore this message.
